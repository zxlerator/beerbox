		<h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
		<br>
		<p>We may collect information about our users in various ways, including those described below. For example, we may collect information that you provide to us, information that we collect through your use of the Services, and information that we collect from publicly available sources or from third parties. We also may collect other information about you, your device, or your use of the Services in ways that we describe to you at the point of collection or otherwise with your consent.</p>

		<p>Information You Provide to Us. In order to use certain Services or to register or otherwise interact with the Services, you may need to provide content or other information. For example, during account registration or in connection with financial transactions, we may ask for information, and you may provide us with information when you participate in a contest or a promotion.</p>

		<p>Information About Your Use of the Services and Other Interactions with Us. In addition to the information you provide to us directly, we may collect information about your use of the Services, such as device information, your IP address, usage and location data. To do this, we may use cookies, web beacons (sometimes called “action tags” or “one pixel .gif files”), web server logs, and other statistics programs as explained in more detailed <a href="#cookies">here</a>. Examples of usage information we may collect, including location information that may be transmitted to us, are explained in more detail <a href="#examples"> here.</a></p>

		<p>Information From Third-Party Sources. We may receive information about you from publicly and commercially available sources. For example, we may receive information about you from a social media site if you connect to the Services through that site. We may combine your information with information we receive from third-party sources.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
		<br>
		<p>To Provide, Manage, and Improve our Products and Services. We may use your information to provide, manage, and improve our operations, features and services, including to deliver the Services, personalize content, understand how you use and interact with the Services. For example, we may use your information to process a transaction you initiate, to respond to inquiries or requests we receive from you or otherwise communicate with you about the Services, to conduct surveys and research and test features in development, and to diagnose and correct technical issues relating to the performance of the Services.</p>

		<p>To Deliver Advertising and Promotional Communications.  We may use your information to deliver promotional communications and advertising to you both on and off the Services and to improve those communications and advertising so that they are more relevant to you. For example, we may periodically contact you with offers, and we may deliver targeted advertisements to you. For information about choices that are available to you in relation to the delivery of targeted advertising click here.</p>

		<p>To Protect the Rights of the Services and Others. We may use your information as we believe is necessary or appropriate to protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of the Services, our employees or agents, or other users and to comply with applicable law.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Affiliated Companies and Vendors. We may share information we collect among our affiliated companies and with vendors, service providers, and other partners that provide contractual services to us. </p>

		<p>Business Partners. We may also share your information with business partners to provide you with our features and services and for direct marketing purposes. The Business partners may provide information about services and products which you may like and they may collect non-personal information about you through employment of cookies or similar technologies to provide such information.</p>

		<p>Third Parties that Provide Content, Advertising, or other Functionality. Some of the content, advertising, and functionality on our Services may be provided by third parties, such as our advertisers and providers of social network plugins. However, we do not share information that personally identifies you (personally identifiable information is information like name or email address that can by itself be used to contact you or identifies who you are) with these third parties unless you give us permission to do so. We may use third-party advertising companies and media partners to serve ads on the websites, applications, and online services on which we advertise our Services. These third-parties may collect or receive certain information about your use of their services or your responses to such advertisements, including through the use of cookies, beacons, and similar technologies, and this information may be combined with information collected across different websites and online services. ZX Ventures is not responsible for the privacy practices of these entities.</p>

		<p>Other Parties When Required by Law, As Necessary to Protect Our Users and Services, or In Connection With a Corporate Transaction. We may share your information as we believe is necessary or appropriate to protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, security, integrity, safety, or property of the Services, our employees, agents or users, and to comply with applicable law or legal process, including responding to requests from public and government authorities and defending against third-party claims. We also reserve the right to transfer any information in the event that we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets to a third party, such as in the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy reorganization or other similar transaction.</p>

		<p>Otherwise With Your Consent or At Your Direction. In addition to the sharing described in this Privacy Policy, we may share information about you with third parties whenever you consent to or direct such sharing. For example, if you voluntarily disclose or post information to a community forum, such information will be published to the community and may be published more widely by a member of the community or the nature of the forum.</p>

		<p>Aggregated Data. We also may provide aggregated data or data that we have taken other measures to de-identify to third parties.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
		<br>
		<p>You are entitled to request to access, correct, or delete your information. We store information for as long as it is necessary to provide Services. Please contact customer service as posted on the site.</p>

		<p>Links to Third-Party Sites</p>
		<p>The Services may link to third-party websites and services that are outside our control. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by other websites, applications, or other services or by your mobile operating system operator, wireless carrier, or other similar providers. You should exercise caution, and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and services you use.</p>

		<p>Data Security</p>
		<p>We have in place physical and technical measures to protect information we collect online. However, as effective as these measures may be, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Children’s Privacy. Our Services are not intended for individuals under the legal drinking age. If we learn that an individual under the legal drinking age has provided us with personal information, we will delete it if required by applicable law.</p>

		<p>Your California Privacy Rights. California residents are entitled once a year, free of charge, to request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. You also have the ability to tell us not to share personally identifiable information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes by contacting customer service.</p>

		<p>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, the Services currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.</p>

		<p>International Transfers. Please be aware that we may transfer your personal information to the United States or to another country where privacy standards may not be equivalent to those in your country.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
		<br>
		<p>We may modify this Privacy Policy. We will notify you of changes by posting changes here or by other appropriate means. Any changes to the Privacy Policy will become effective when the updated policy is posted on the Services. Your use of the Services or your provision of information to use the Services following such changes indicates your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
		
		<p id="cookies">How We Use Cookies, Web Beacons, and similar technolgies</p>

		<p>We and third parties that provide content, advertising, or functionality on the Services, may use cookies, web beacons (sometimes called “action tags” or “one pixel .gif files”), web server logs, standard web measurement or other statistics programs, and similar technologies to facilitate administration and navigation on the Site, to better understand and improve the Services, to determine and improve the advertising shown to you here or elsewhere, and to provide you with a customized online experience.</p>
		<p>Cookies. Cookies are small files that are placed on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer or device so that you can be recognized as the same user across one or more browsing sessions, and across one or more sites. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:</p>

		<ul style="padding-left:20px">
			<li><p>Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you do not have to enter those credentials each time you visit a Service</p></li>
			<li><p>Cookies can help us and third parties understand which parts of the Services are the most popular because they help us see which pages and features visitors access and how much time they spend on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt the Services and provide you with a better experience.</p></li>
			<li><p>Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you do not receive the same ad each time you access a Service.</p></li>
		</ul>

		<p>Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to do so or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent. If you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies. If you disable browser cookies or flash cookies, it may interfere with the proper functioning of the Services. </p>

		<p>Beacons. We, along with third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or “pixels”) that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. We and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of the Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.</p>

		<p>Local Storage & Other Tracking Technologies. We, along with third parties, may use other kinds of technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with the Services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies, please click here.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>TARGETED ADVERTISING</h2>
		<br>
		<p>In some cases, we and advertisers on the Services work with third-party partners to help deliver advertisements tailored to your interests. These vendors include ad networks, audience segment providers, ad serving vendors. Through tracking technologies such as cookies, these parties may collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited) in order to deliver ads on our Services and other websites and online services that are relevant to you. You can learn more about targeted advertising and make certain privacy choices here.</p>
		<p id="examples">Examples of usage information, including location information, we may collect include the following:</p>

		<ul style="padding-left:20px">
			<li><p>Device information—such as your hardware model, IP address, other unique device identifiers, operating system version, and settings of the device you use to access the Services.</p></li>
			<li><p>Usage information—such as information about the Services you use, the time and duration of your use of the Services and other information about your interaction with content offered through a Service, and any information stored in cookies and similar technologies that we have set on your device.</p></li>
			<li><p>Location information—such as your device’s GPS signal or information about nearby WiFi access points, location beacons and cell towers that may be transmitted to us when you use certain Services or certain location-based informational, marketing or public service applications that we or our business partners offer.</p></li>
