Should applicable law not permit the foregoing exclusion of express or implied warranties, then ZX Ventures hereby grants the minimum express or implied warranty required by such applicable law.  No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from ZX Ventures, its employees, agents, suppliers or any other persons shall create any warranty, representation or guarantee not expressly stated in this section.  ZX Ventures does not make any warranties that the Website will be uninterrupted, secure or error free or that your use of the Website will meet your expectations, or that the Website, Content, or any portion thereof, is correct, accurate, or reliable.

		<br><h2>LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY</h2><br>
		<p>Your use of the Website is at your own risk.

You hereby waive any and all claims against ZX Venture and its affiliates, agents, representatives and licensors arising out of your use of the Website.  Because some states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages, these provisions may not apply to you and you might have additional rights. If any portion of this limitation on liability is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, then the aggregate liability of ZX Ventures and its affiliates shall not exceed one hundred United States dollars (US$100.)  The limitation of liability herein is a fundamental element of the basis of the bargain and reflects a fair allocation of risk.  The Website would not be provided without such limitations and you agree that the limitations and exclusions of liability, disclaimers and exclusive remedies specified herein will survive even if found to have failed in their essential purpose. </p>
